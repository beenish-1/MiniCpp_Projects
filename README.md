## About This Repository

This repository contains multiple **basic C++ programs** that I built while practicing CCP.
Each program solves a simple real-world or logic-based problem.

---

## Learning Focus

The programs in this repository are designed to reinforce:

- Core C++ syntax and structure
- Conditional logic and control flow
- Iterative problem solving
- Input handling and basic computation
- Clear and readable code organization

The intent is to build a strong conceptual base that supports further growth in software development.

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal academic archive and practice space.
It reflects continuous learning, experimentation, and improvement in C++ programming fundamentals.
